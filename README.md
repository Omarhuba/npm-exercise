# NPM
Work in your groups and follow the instructions below step by step and make sure to write down answers to any questions marked with a :camel:. Write down your answers inside this README.md file.

### In this lab we will learn:

- Reading and implementing basic requirements
- Using an npm package and independently reading it's api docs and finding apropriate functions to use
- Publishing a package to npm
- The difference between es6 modules and "old" javascript packages on npm
- Using npm packages locally with npm link


# Time period helper
You are tasked with building a utility library with time and date related helper functions to be published to npm. The folder `date-and-time-helpers` contains the skeleton for the utility library. The `reddays` folder contains a `react` application that should use the `date-and-time-helpers` library.

### 1. Fork
One group member forks this repo with your github account and adds your group member as a collaborator. Both members then clone your fork to your local machines.

### 2. Get familiar
Look inside the `reddays` folder and run `npm install` and `npm start` inside to see how the app looks like in the browser. Try selecting a couple of different dates and see how the app is behaving.

### 3. Code the timeHelper function
Go to the `date-and-time-helpers` folder and look at the `src/timeHelper.mjs` file. Your first task is to code this function while making sure to fulfill the following requirements:

- The function should take 2 arguments, `startDate` and `endDate` that are strings eg. `"2021-08-01" and "2021-08-31"`
- You need to use the [day.js](https://day.js.org/) library.	
	- Install it with npm
	- Have a look in its docs to try to find a couple of good functions to help with implementing the requirements below.
- The function should return a "nice" string of text representing the time period that stretches between the two dates like the following:
	- A full month should be represented as the name of the month followed by the year, eg. `startDate=2021-08-01, endDate=2021-08-31 should return "August"`
	- A full year should be represented as the year itself, eg. `startDate=2021-01-01, endDate=2021-01-01 should return "2021"`
	- All other periods should return "No valid period"
- Start with added the following to the beginning of timeHelper.mjs:

		import dayjs from 'dayjs'
		import 'dayjs/locale/en-gb.js'
		dayjs.locale('en-gb') // en-gb starts week on monday, en does not
		const yyyymmdd = 'YYYY-MM-DD' // useful for simple .format(yyyymmdd)

Tip: A simple way of temporarily testing your function in `timeHelper.mjs` could be to run the following line in your terminal:

	node timeHelper.mjs
	// ...but in order for that to work you'd have to add some code to timeHelper.mjs such as:
	const timeHelper = ({startDate, endDate}) => {
		return 'November'
	}	
	// Added lines:
	console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-08-01', endDate: '2021-08-31'}), ' == August')
	console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-05-01', endDate: '2021-05-31'}), ' == May')
	console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-01-01', endDate: '2021-12-31'}), ' == 2021')
	console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2018-01-01', endDate: '2018-12-31'}), ' == 2018')
	console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-01-05', endDate: '2021-03-15'}), ' == No valid period')

	// console.log('\n--------------\nHarder requirements ("extras"):')
	// console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2019-11-01', endDate: '2019-11-30'}), ' == November 2019')
	// console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2018-08-01', endDate: '2018-08-31'}), ' == August 2018')
	// console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-07-05', endDate: '2021-08-20'}), ' == 5 Jul - 20 Aug')
	// console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-01-01', endDate: '2021-05-30'}), ' == 1 Jan - 30 May')
	// console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2019-11-10', endDate: '2019-11-29'}), ' == 10 Nov 2019 - 29 Nov 2019')
	// console.log(timeHelper({startDate: '2021-10-18', endDate: '2021-10-24'}), ' == W42')




:camel: **Question 1**: can you think of any other (better) way of testing your utility function while developing it?

### 4. Publish to npm
When you've finished your function publish it to npm.

- In your terminal, check who you're logged in as in npm `npm whoami`
- If you're not logged in, follow [these instructions](http://npm.github.io/installation-setup-docs/installing/logging-in-and-out.html) to create an npm account and login to npm from your terminal.
- Run `npm publish` inside the `date-and-time-helpers` folder

:camel: **Question 2**: Do you need to have commited your code to repo before publishing to npm?

:camel: **Question 3**: what error message do you get and how do you solve it?

- After you figure our what's wrong and fixed it, run `npm publish` again

:camel: **Question 4**: what error message do you get this time and how do you solve it?

- After you figure our what's wrong and fixed it, run `npm publish` again. The publish should work and you should get an output similar to the one below. If you don't, ask the teacher or a classmate for help.

```

- Open your browser to https://www.npmjs.com/package/[your-package-name] and have a look at it

:camel: **Question 5**: How many dependencies and what different kind of dependencies can you see for your package on npm?

### 5. Use your newly published package

- In your terminal, go to the reddays folder and install your newly published package with npm
- In `App.js` create a new react component that uses your newly published timeHelper function where it says: `{/*	Component goes here */}`

:camel: **Question 6**: can you use your timeHelper function defined in `timeHelper.mjs` directly by `import timeHelper from 'date-and-time-helpers'`? Is something more needed?

- Make sure your component "passes" all the tests by manually clicking on the blue `TestLink`s in your browser and make sure your component is showing the expected output.

You've made it to check point 1! We'll go through the assignment so far shortly. Go ahead and do the extra **6.** below while you wait for your classmates to reach here too.

### 6. Extra
The requirement of your function in timeHelper.mjs has gotten tougher (use red test links in browser to test these):

- A full month in the `current` year should be represented as the name of the month, eg. `startDate=2021-08-01, endDate=2021-08-31 should return "August"`
- A full month in the any other year should be represented as the name of the month and that year, eg. `startDate=2018-08-01, endDate=2018-08-31 should return "August 2018"`
- A full week in the `current` year should be represented as a "W" and the number of the week, eg. `startDate=2021-10-18, endDate=2021-10-24 should return "W42"`
- Any other time period in the `current` year should return both dates in a "nice" string like so: "20 aug - 31 dec"
- Any other time period outside the `current` year should return both dates in a "nice" string like so: "20 aug 2018 - 31 dec 2019"

# Time period helper continued
Now let's continue to use and work with your npm library.

### 1. Commonjs

- In your terminal, open the commonjs folder
- Install your npm package
- Run `npm start`

:camel: **Question 1**: What error are you getting? What do you think the problem is?

### 2. Build for commonjs

- In your terminal, open date-and-time-helpers and run `npm run build`

:camel: **Question 2**: What happened?

- Republish your npm package
- In your terminal, go back to commonjs and reinstall your package and make sure you get the new version
- run `npm start` again

:camel: **Question 3**: Why did it work this time?

- In date-and-time-helpers, examine `package.json` and specifically the `scripts` section.

:camel: **Question 3**: What does `"clean", "build", "dist", "pub"` do and how do you imaging they can be used in an everyday work flow?

- Try bumping the version number in `date-and-time-helpers/package.json` and run `npm run pub`

:camel: **Question 4**: What do you think happened from looking at the output in the terminal?

### 3. Work locally
It's not a very nice workflow having to republish new versions of your package every time you want to change something and use it in reddays.

- Read about [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link)
- Get npm link to work for you and implement the updated requirements below without having to republish your package

The requirement of your function in timeHelper.mjs has gotten tougher: (NOTE: If you already did this as extra above, continue to the next step)

Start by uncommenting the `Harder requirements` in timeHelper.js.

- A full month in the `current` year should be represented as the name of the month, eg. `startDate=2021-08-01, endDate=2021-08-31 should return "August"`
- A full month in the any other year should be represented as the name of the month and that year, eg. `startDate=2018-08-01, endDate=2018-08-31 should return "August 2018"`

- After you've implemented the features above, click red links to test that it works in the browser for reddays

:metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: 

You've made it to check point 2! We'll go through the assignment so far shortly. Go ahead and do the extra **4.** below while you wait for your classmates to reach here too.

:metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: :metal: 

### 4. Extra
- If you havent done them before, continue implementing these harder requirements
	- A full week in the `current` year should be represented as a "W" and the number of the week, eg. `startDate=2021-10-18, endDate=2021-10-24 should return "W42"`
	- Any other time period in the `current` year should return both dates in a "nice" string like so: "20 aug - 31 dec"
	- Any other time period outside the `current` year should return both dates in a "nice" string like so: "20 aug 2018 - 31 dec 2019"

- In `App.js` you'll find `<div className="day-list"></div>`
- Inside that div, list out all the days residing in src/reddays.js by using the RedDay component
- Make sure to filter out and show only the red days between the two selected dates startDate and endDate.


# Finish
This will not be part of a hand-in so if you want you can delete your npm package and your fork of this repo if you want.

:camel::camel::camel::camel::camel::camel::camel: Good job!!! :camel::camel::camel::camel::camel::camel::camel:
